**Examples**

The scripts I use for my own `rust` software SlackBuilds on [SlackBuilds Online](https://slackbuilds.org) can be found here.

All of them add the step of modifying a base SlackBuild with new version information to save time, and some of them perform other actions to generate `man` pages, shell completion files, etc.
